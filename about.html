          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Based in the townland of Carrigans, on the outskirts of Omagh, the
          McConnell farm covers roughly 300 acres, and is run by husband and
          wife duo, Drew and Val.<br />
          Drew initially studied Accountancy before he decided that he
          much preferred cows to people! He took over the farm in 1993, and is
          now the 3rd generation McConnell to farm the land. They are aided by
          their 3 daughters: Debbie, Kathy, and Ellie; and new pup Mac.</p>

          <h2>Research & Projects</h2>
          <p>The McConnell's are firm believers that research and technology is
            the future of the agricultural industry. The farm has been involved
            in several research projects over the years, with a number of
            organisations, including:
              <ul>
                <li>Focus Farms;</li>
                <li>Ulster Grassland Society;</li>
                <li>British Grassland Society; and</li>
                <li>AFBI.</li>
              </ul>
            <br />
            These programmes have provided the farm with the opportunity to
            meet farmers from all over the world. It has hosted groups of
            farmers and students from all over the UK and Ireland, and also
            countries such as the Netherlands, Hungary, and New Zealand.

            <h2>New Technologies</h2>
            <p>In 2014, the farm installed a new, fully automated milking machine.
            The robotic milker allows about 50 cows to be milked of their own
            accord 2 or 3 times a day. Studies have shown that automatic milking
            systems improve, not only milk yields, but also cow welfare.
            <br />The farm also uses a 'Heat Detection System' for easier, and
            more accurate tracking of when a cow is in heat. The cow has a
            collar around her neck which tracks her movements. If she is more
            active throughout the day, this is a good indicator that she is in
            heat.</p>
